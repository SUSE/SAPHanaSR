.SH NAME
SAPHanaSR-tester \- Functional testing for SAPHanaSR clusters.
.PP
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
SAPHanaSR-tester is a suite of tools for automating functional tests of SAP HANA
system replication HA clusters.
.PP
.B SAPHanaSR-tester is shipped as technology preview. 
.PP
The package is focussing on functional tests for the SAPHanaSR resource agents,
alert agents, HA/DR provider hook scripts, the related configuration of the Linux
cluster and the SAP HANA database pair.
In addition to this functional tests, specific tests for the underlying
infrastructure, Linux OS and cluster as well as the database need to be done.
See manual page SAPHanaSR-tests-basic-cluster(7).
.PP
SAPHanaSR-tester provides predefined functional tests for scale-up and scale-out
scenarios. This tests could be run out-of-the-box. The predefined tests also
can be used for creating new test definitions. So parameters for timing and
expected attributes can be customised.
.PP
The test cases are defined in dedicated files. Each test is separated into 
steps. For each step there is an expectation for SAPHanaSR attributes, which
need to match. Additionally each step defines the 'next' step and an optional
action to be triggered if the step status has been reached (all expectations
match).
.PP
The tests usually are self-contained and can run in any order. Entry point
always is a clean and idle Linux cluster and a clean HANA pair in sync. Same
is true for the final state. Of course the HANA sites may change during the
test. Consequently, each predefined test starts and ends with checking the
clean status of the HANA pair.
.PP
For tests involving complex actions on the cluster nodes, predefined shell
scripts are executed remotely.

\fB*\fP Input: Test cases and test system properties
.PP
a. Test cases are defined in JSON files. Each case is described in one file.
It also can reference to defaults.json for common status definitions.
Each step contains an expectation for SAPHanaSR attributes, which need to
match.
Each test step status is described by one or more conditions. Each condition
is described by one comparision.
See manual page SAPHanaSR-tests-syntax(5) for details, see also the EXAMPLES
section in SAPHanaSR-tests-angi-ScaleUp(7) and SAPHanaSR-tests-angi-ScaleOut(7).
.PP
b. Test system properties are defined in JSON files.
This properties are decribing the test system. The properties are separated from
the test cases, because they need to be adapted for each system. The values are
static during test run and common for all test on one system.
The test cases on the other hand are mostly similar for all test systems.
See manual page SAPHanaSR-tests-syntax(5) for details, see also example below.

\fB*\fR Installing SAPHanaSR-tester.
.PP
The SAPHanaSR-tester is installed on an node outside the Linux cluster.
Password-less login for user root is prepared. The tester properties are
adapted to the SAPHanaSR scale-up cluster. Example scale-up cluster nodes are
node1 and node2, SID is Q42, instance number is 85, HANA´s virtual IP address is
192.168.178.85, database user key is TESTER.

\fB*\fR Creating an userkey for database access.
.PP
An userkey for user <sid>admin is created to allow password-less login as user
SYSTEM to the HANA database. This is needed for some test cases, e.g. 
free_log_backup. The example user is q42admin, key is TESTER, instance number
is 85, database user SYSTEM´s password is SuSE12345. Do this on both nodes.
.br
Refer to SAP HANA documentation for further information on database users,
permissions and the user keystore.
.br
Note: Never do this on production systems.

.SH REQUIREMENTS
.PP
For the current version of the SAPHanaSR-tester, the capabilities are limited
to the following:
.PP
\fB*\fP SLES-for-SAP 15 SP4 or newer.
.PP
\fB*\fP Resource agents and configuration of SAPHanaSR-angi 1.2 or newer is supported.
.PP
\fB*\fP Resource agents and configuration of SAPHanaSR or SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut
with additional package SAPHanaSR-tester-client is supported.
.PP
\fB*\fP Scale-up setups with or without multi-target replication.
No scale-up multi-SID (MCOS) setups.
.PP
\fB*\fP The tester checks cluster attributes via SAPHanaSR-showAttr. It only
detects an status represented by those attributes.
.PP
\fB*\fP Scale-out setups with or without multi-target replication.
No HANA host auto-failover.
.PP
\fB*\fP SAPHanaSR-tester is installed and used on an node outside the Linux
cluster.
.PP
\fB*\fP User root needs password-less access to the Linux cluster nodes.
.PP
\fB*\fP On the cluster nodes, user <sid>adm has a userkey for password-less
login as database user SYSTEM into the HANA database. This is only needed for
some test cases.
.PP
\fB*\fP Package python3-paramiko is needed on the tester machine for the
tester´s multi-node feature. The cluster nodes need to run an openssh-server
compatible to that python3-paramiko.
.PP
\fB*\fP Package ClusterTools2 is needed on the cluster nodes.
.PP
\fB*\fP Strict time synchronization between the cluster nodes and the tester
node, e.g. NTP. All nodes have configured the same timezone.
.PP
\fB*\fP The services pacemaker and corosync need to be enabled for this tests. 
If disk-based SBD is used, then service sbd enabled and SBD_STARTMODE=always
is needed for this tests. The stonith-action=reboot is needed in any case.
This cluster basics might be different for production.
.PP
\fB*\fP In some cases the various timings for stonith and service startup might
need alignement to prevent fenced nodes from re-joining the cluster before the
resource takeover has been finished. This most likely applies if stonith-timeout
is long, but the cluster nodes are booting very fast.
.PP
\fB*\fP Sufficient disk space, particularly for HANA transaction logs, e.g.
/hana/log/. Depending on the backup implementation, also space for log backups
might be needed, e.g. /hana/shared/<SID>/HDB<nr>/backup/. Strict housekeeping
might help as well.
.PP
\fB*\fP The tester must not be used for production systems.
Most tests are disruptive.
