.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBSAPHana\fP is a resource agent for SAP HANA databases in scale-up setups.
It manages take-over for a SAP HANA database with system replication in an OCF master/slave configuration.
.PP
System replication will help to replicate the database data from one computer
to another computer in order to compensate for database failures.
With this mode of operation, internal SAP HANA high-availability (HA) mechanisms
and the resource agent must work together.
The SAPHana resource agent (RA) performs the actual check of the SAP HANA
database instances and is configured as a master/slave resource.
Managing the two SAP HANA instances means that the resource agent controls
the start/stop of the instances. In addition the resource agent is able to monitor
the SAP HANA databases on landscape host configuration level.
For this monitoring the resource agent relies on interfaces provided by SAP.
.PP
A third task of the resource agent is to also check the synchronisation status
of the two SAP HANA databases. If the synchronisation is not "SOK", then the cluster
avoids a takeover to the secondary site, if the primary fails.
This is to improve the data consistency.
.PP
The resource agent uses the following five interfaces provided by SAP:
.PP
1. \fBsapcontrol/sapstartsrv\fR
.br
The interface sapcontrol/sapstartsrv is used to start/stop a HANA database
instance/system
.PP
2. \fBlandscapeHostConfiguration\fR
.br
The interface is used to monitor a HANA system. The python script is named
landscapeHostConfiguration.py.
landscapeHostConfiguration.py has some detailed output about HANA system status
and node roles. For our monitor the overall status is relevant. This overall 
status is reported by the return code of the script:
0: Internal Fatal, 1: ERROR, 2: WARNING, 3: INFO, 4: OK
The SAPHana resource agent will interpret return code 0 as FATAL, 1 as not-running
(or ERROR) and return codes 2+3+4 as RUNNING.
.PP
3. \fBhdbnsutil\fR
.br
The interface hdbnsutil is used to check the "topology" of the system replication
as well as the current configuration (primary/secondary) of a SAP HANA database
instance. A second task of the interface is the posibility to run a system
replication takeover (sr_takeover) or to register a former primary to a newer one
(sr_register).
.PP
4. \fBsystemReplicationStatus / hdbsql\fR
.br
SAP HANA 1.0 SPS 9 and later provide a python script "systemReplicationStatus.py" for
checking the system replication. The SAPHanaSR 0.152 and later uses this script
instead of hdbsql. So, to manage recent versions of SAP HANA with recent versions
of SAPHanSR, the hdbsql is not used anymore. 
When running SAP HANA 1.0 SPS 8 and older or SAPHanaSR 0.151 and older, hdbsql is used.  
As long as we need to use hdbsql you need to set up secure store users for Linux
user root to be able to access the SAP HANA database. You need to configure a secure
store user key "SLEHALOC" which can connect the SAP HANA database. 
.PP
5. \fBsaphostctrl\fR
.br
The interface saphostctrl uses the function ListInstances to figure out the virtual
host name of the SAP HANA instance. This is the hostname used during the HANA
installation.
.PP
To make configuring the cluster as simple as possible, the additional
SAPHanaTopology resource agent runs on all nodes of a SLE HA cluster and gathers
information about the statuses and configurations of SAP HANA system replications.
The SAPHanaTopology RA is designed as a normal (stateless) clone.

.SH SUPPORTED PARAMETERS
.br
This resource agent supports the following parameters:
.PP
\fBSID\fR
.RS 4
SAP System Identifier. Has to be same on both instances. Example "SID=SLE".
.RE
.PP
\fBInstanceNumber\fR
.RS 4
Number of the SAP HANA database. Has to be same on both instances. For system replication also Instance Number+1 is blocked. Example "InstanceNumber=00".
.RE
.PP
\fBDIR_EXECUTABLE\fR
.RS 4
The full qualified path where to find sapstartsrv and sapcontrol.
Specify this parameter, if you have changed the SAP kernel directory location
after the default SAP installation.
.br
Optional, well known directories will be searched by default.
.RE
.PP
\fBDIR_PROFILE\fR
.RS 4
The full qualified path where to find the SAP START profile.
Specify this parameter, if you have changed the SAP profile directory location
after the default SAP installation.
.br
Optional, well known directories will be searched by default.
.RE
.PP
\fBINSTANCE_PROFILE\fR
.RS 4
The name of the SAP HANA instance profile. Specify this parameter,
if you have changed the name of the SAP HANA instance profile
after the default SAP installation.
Normally you do not need to set this parameter.
.br
Optional, well known directories will be searched by default.
.RE 
.PP
\fBPREFER_SITE_TAKEOVER\fR
.RS 4
Defines whether RA should prefer to takeover to slave instance instead of restarting
master locally.
Example: "PREFER_SITE_TAKEOVER=true".
.br
Optional. Default value: false\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBDUPLICATE_PRIMARY_TIMEOUT\fR
.RS 4
Time difference needed between two primary time stamps (LPTs), in case
a dual-primary situation occurs. If the difference between both node's
last primary time stamps is less than DUPLICATE_PRIMARY_TIMESTAMP,
then the cluster holds one or both instances in a "WAITING" status.
This is to give an admin the chance to react on a takeover.
Note: How the cluster proceeds after the DUPLICATE_PRIMARY_TIMESTAMP
has passed, depends on the parameter AUTOMATED_REGISTER.
See also the examples section below.
.br
Optional. Default value: 7200\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBAUTOMATED_REGISTER\fR
.RS 4
Defines, whether a former primary instance should be registered automatically
by the resource agent during cluster/resource start, if the DUPLICATE_PRIMARY_TIMEOUT
is expired.
Example: "AUTOMATED_REGISTER=true".
.br
Default value: false\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBSAPHanaFilter\fR
.RS 4
Outdated parameter. Please not use it any longer.
This resource agent parameter has been replaced by the cluster property 'hana_${sid}_glob_filter'.
.RE
.PP
.\"
.SH SUPPORTED PROPERTIES
.br
\fBhana_${sid}_glob_filter\fR

* Below is an example configuration for the two SAPHana resources in a cost-optimized scenario.
.RS 2
The first SAPHana resource is a master/slave pair of production HANAs with a system replication (e.g. PRD), managed by the SAPHana RA. The second SAPHana is a single test HANA (e.g. TST) running together with the productive HANA secondary on the same node. This second -single- HANA is managed as a primitive resource by the SAPDatabase RA. Of course, a SAPHanaTopology clone resource is needed to make this work. It is also necessary to prepare an HANA HA/DR hook script for adjusting the secondary HANA's memory in case of sr_takeover (see URLs below).

* Initiate an administrative takeover of the HANA primary from one node to the other one.
If the cluster should also register the former primary as secondary, AUTOMATED_REGISTER="true"
is needed.
Before the takeover will be initiated, the status of the Linux cluster and the HANA system
replication have to be checked. The takeover should only be initiated as forced migration.
After the takeover has been finished, the migration rule has to be deleted.

* Use of DUPLICATE_PRIMARY_TIMEOUT and Last Primary Timestamp (LPT) in case the primary node has been crashed completely.

Typically on each side where the RA detects a running primary a time stamp is written to the node's attributes (last primary seen at time: lpt). If the timestamps ("last primary seen at") differ less than the DUPLICATE_PRIMARY_TIMEOUT than the RA could not automatically decide which of the two primaries is the better one.

1. nodeA is primary and has a current time stamp, nodeB is secondary and has
a secondary marker set:
.br
nodeA: 1479201695
.br
nodeB: 30

2. Now nodeA crashes and nodeB takes over:
.br
(nodeA: 1479201695)
.br
nodeB: 1479201700

3. A bit later nodeA comes back into the cluster:
.br
nodeA: 1479201695
.br
nodeB: 1479202000
.br
You see while nodeA keeps its primary down the old timestamp is kept.
NodeB increases its timestamp on each monitor run.

4. After some more time (depending on the parameter DUPLICATE_PRIMARY_TIMEOUT)
.br
nodeA: 1479201695
.br
nodeB: 1479208895
.br
Now the time stamps differ >= DUPLICATE_PRIMARY_TIMEOUT. The algorithm defines
nodeA now as "the looser" and depending on the AUTOMATED_REGISTER the nodeA
will become the secondary.

5. NodeA would be registered:
.br
nodeA: 10
.br
nodeB: 1479208900

6. Some time later the secondary gets into sync
.br
nodeA: 30

nodeB: 1479209100

* Use of DUPLICATE_PRIMARY_TIMEOUT and Last Primary Timestamp (LPT) in case the the database on primary node has been crashed, but the node is still alive.

Typically on each side where the RA detects a running primary a time stamp is written to the node's attributes (last primary seen at time: lpt). If the timestamps ("last primary seen at") differ less than the DUPLICATE_PRIMARY_TIMEOUT than the RA could not automatically decide which of the two primaries is the better one.

1. nodeA is primary and has a current time stamp, nodeB is secondary and has
a secondary marker set:
.br
nodeA: 1479201695
.br
nodeB: 30

2. Now HANA on nodeA crashes and nodeB takes over:
.br
nodeA: 1479201695
.br
nodeB: 1479201700

3. As the cluster could be sure to properly stopped the HANA instance at nodeA
it *immediately* marks the old primary to be a register candidate,
if AUTOMATED_REGISTER is true:
.br
nodeA: 10
.br
nodeB: 1479201760

4. Depending on the AUTOMATED_REGISTER parameter the RA will also immediately
regisiter the former primary to become the new secondary:
.br
nodeA: 10
.br
nodeB: 1479201820

5. And after a while the secondary gets in sync
.br
nodeA: 30
.br
nodeB: 1479202132
