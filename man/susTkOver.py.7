.SH NAME
susTkOver.py \- Provider for SAP HANA srHook method preTakeover().
.PP
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
susTkOver.py can be used to provide a script for the SAP HANA srHook method preTakeover().

The SAP HANA nameserver provides a Python-based API ("HA/DR providers"), which 
is called at important points of the host auto-failover and system replication 
takeover process. These so called hooks can be used for arbitrary operations
that need to be executed. The method preTakeover() is called before the
sr_takeover action.

susTkOver.py allows manual takeover of the HANA primary if the SAP HANA
multi-state resource (managed by SAPHana or SAPHanaController) is set into
maintenance or the Linux cluster is stopped.
Otherwise the manual takeover is blocked. See also manual page
SAPHanaSR_maintenance_examples(7).

This hook script needs to be configured and activated on all HANA nodes.

.SH SUPPORTED PARAMETERS
* The "HA/DR providers" API accepts the following parameters for the 
ha_dr_provider_susTkOver section:
.TP
\fB[ha_dr_provider_susTkOver]\fP
.TP
\fBprovider = susTkOver\fP
Mandatory. Must not be changed.
.TP
\fBpath = [ /usr/share/SAPHanaSR | /usr/share/SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut ]\fP
Mandatory. Depending on path delivered within RPM package. Please change only if requested.
.TP
\fBexecution_order = [ INTEGER ]\fP
Mandatory. Order might depend on other hook scripts.
.TP
\fBsustkover_timeout = [ INTEGER ]\fP
Optional. Default is 30 seconds.
.PP
* The "HA/DR providers" API accepts the following parameter for the trace section:
.TP
\fB[trace]\fP
.TP
\fBha_dr_sustkover = [ info | debug ]\fP
Optional. Default is info. Will be added automatically, if not set.
.PP
* The SAPHanaController and SAPHana RAs are recognizing the pending takeover
request via the following cluster attributes:
.TP
\fBsra = [ T | R | - ]\fP
.PP
HANA system replication takeover action, indicated by preTakeover().
.PP
The node attribute system replication action is checked by the HA/DR provider API
method preTakeover(). It is set by the resource agent SAPHana or SAPHanaController. 
It indicates whether a takeover or registration is ongoing.
.br
T = Takeover on new primary (sr_takeover) ongoing.
.br
R = Registration on new secondary (sr_register) ongoing.
.br
- = No action pending.
.TP
\fBsrah = [ T | R | - ]\fP
.PP
HANA system replication action history

The node attribute system replication action history stores actions in CIB
attributes for later use, for root cause analysis.

.SH REQUIREMENTS 
1. SAP HANA 2.0 SPS06 or later provides the HA/DR provider hook method
preTakeover() with multi-target aware parameters and separate return code
for Linux HA clusters.
.PP
2. No other HADR provider hook script should be configured for the
preTakeover() method. Hook scripts for other methods, provided in
SAPHanaSR and SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut, can be used in parallel to susTkOver.py, if
not documented contradictingly.
.PP
3. The user ${sid}adm needs execution permission as user root for the command 
SAPHanaSR-hookHelper
.PP
4. The hook provider needs to be added to the HANA global configuration,
in memory and on disk (in persistence).
.PP
5. If the hook provider should be pre-compiled, the particular Python version
that comes with SAP HANA has to be used.
