.SH NAME
SAPHanaSR \- Tools for automating SAP HANA system replication in scale-up setups.
.PP

.SH DESCRIPTION
.\"
\fBOverview\fR
.PP
The SAPHanaSR package provides resource agents (RA) and tools for setting
up and managing automation of SAP HANA system replication (SR) in scale-up setups.
.pp
System replication will help to replicate the database data from one site to
another site in order to compensate for database failures. With this mode of
operation, internal SAP HANA high-availability (HA) mechanisms and the Linux
cluster have to work together.
.PP
The SAPHana RA performs the actual check of the SAP HANA
database instances and is configured as a master/slave resource.
Managing the two SAP HANA instances means that the resource agent controls
the start/stop of the instances. In addition the resource agent is able to
monitor the SAP HANA databases on landscape host configuration level.
For this monitoring the resource agent relies on interfaces provided by SAP.
As long as the HANA landscape status is not "ERROR" the Linux cluster will not
act. The main purpose of the Linux cluster is to handle the take-over to the
other site. Only if the HANA landscape status indicates that HANA can not recover
from the failure and the replication is in sync, then Linux will act.
.PP
An important task of the resource agent is to check the synchronisation status
of the two SAP HANA databases. If the synchronisation is not "SOK", then the
cluster avoids to takeover to the secondary side, if the primary fails. This is
to improve the data consistency.
.PP
Note: To automate SAP HANA SR in scale-out setups, please use the package
SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut.

\fBScenarios\fR
.PP
.\" TODO
In order to illustrate the meaning of the above overview, some important
situations are described below. This is not a complete description of all
situations. 
.PP
1. \fBSite take-over after primary has failed\fR
.br
This is the basic use case for HANA SR automation. 
.br
1. site_A is primary, site_B is secondary - they are in sync.
.br
2. site_A crashes.
.br
3. site_B does the take-over and runs now as new primary. The Linux cluster
always makes sure the node at site_B is shut off before any other action is
initiated.
.PP
2. \fBPrevention against dual-primary\fR
.br
A primary absolutely must never be started, if the cluster does not know
anything about the other site.
On initial cluster start, the cluster needs to detect a valid HANA system
replication setup, including system replication status (SOK) and last primary
timestamp (LPT). This is neccessary to ensure data integrity.
.PP
The rational behind this is shown in the following scenario:
.br
1. site_A is primary, site_B is secondary - they are in sync.
.br
2. site_A crashes (remember the HANA ist still marked primary).
.br
3. site_B does the take-over and runs now as new primary.
.br
4. DATA GETS CHANGED ON NODE2 BY PRODUCTION
.br
5. The admin also stops the cluster on site_B (we have two HANAs both
   internally marked down and primary now).
.br
6. What, if the admin would now restart the cluster on site_A?
.br
6.1 site_A would take its own CIB after waiting for the initial fencing
    time for site_B.
.br
6.2 It would "see" its own (cold) primary and the fact that there was a
    secondary.
.br
6.3 It would start the HANA from point of time of step 1.->2. (the crash),
    so all data changed inbetween would be lost.
.br
This is why the Linux cluster needs to enforce a restart inhibit.
.PP
There are two options to get back both, SAP HANA SR and the Linux cluster,
into a fully functional state:
.br
a) the admin starts both nodes again
.br
b) In the situation where the site_B is still down, the admin starts the
   primary on site_A manually.
.br
The Linux cluster will follow this administrative decision. In both cases the
administrator should register and start a secondary as soon as posible. This
avoids a full log partition with consequence of a DATABASE STUCK.
.PP
3. \fBAutomatic registration as secondary after site failure and takeover\fR
.br
The cluster can be configured to register a former primary database
automatically as secondary. If this option is set, the resource agent 
will register a former primary database as secondary during cluster/resource
start.
.PP
4. \fBSite take-over not preferred over local re-start\fR
.br
SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut allows to configure, if you prefer to takeover to the
secondary after the primary landscape fails. The alternative is to restart the
primary landscape, if it fails and only to takeover when no local restart is
possible anymore. This can be tuned by SAPHana(7) parameters.
.br
The current implementation only allows to takeover in case the landscape status
reports 1 (ERROR). The cluster will not takeover, when the SAP HANA still
tries to repair a local failure.
.\" see \fBPREFER_SITE_TAKEOVER\fR
.PP
\fBImplementation\fR
.PP
The two HANA database systems (primary and secondary site) are managed by the
same single Linux cluster. The number of nodes in that single Linux cluster
usually is two.
.PP
The HANA consists of two sites with one node each.
.br
Note: A third site can be added, with another system replication (aka replication
chaining). This will be tolerated by the cluster. Nevertheless, this additional
pieces are not managed by the cluster. E.g. if the direction of system replication
between the two cluster nodes changes, the third site must be disconnected before
hand. So, such a replication chaining does not allow to use the AUTOMATED_REGISTER
feature of SAPHanaSR.
.PP
A common STONITH mechanism is set up for all nodes across all the sites.
.PP
Since the IP address of the primary HANA database system is managed by the
cluster, only that single IP address is needed to access any nameserver
candidate.
.PP
\fBBest Practice\fR
.PP
\fB*\fR Use two independent corosync rings, at least one of them on bonded network.
Resulting in at least three physical links. Unicast is preferred. 
.PP
\fB*\fR Use Stonith Block Device (SBD), shared LUNs across all nodes on all
sites. Of course, together with hardware watchdog.
.PP
\fB*\fR Align all timeouts in the Linux cluster with the timeouts of the underlying
storage and multipathing.
.PP
\fB*\fR Check the installation of OS and Linux cluster on all nodes before doing
any functional tests.
.PP
\fB*\fR Carefully define, perform, and document tests for all scenarios that should
be covered. 
.PP
\fB*\fR Test HANA features without Linux cluster before doing the overall
cluster tests.
.PP
\fB*\fR Test basic Linux cluster features without HANA before doing the overall
cluster tests.
.PP
\fB*\fR Be patient. For detecting the overall HANA status, the Linux cluster needs
a certain amount of time, depending on the HANA and the configured intervalls and
timeouts.
.PP
\fB*\fR Before doing anything, always check for the Linux cluster's idle status,
left-over migration constraints, and resource failures as well as the HANA
landscape status, and the HANA SR status.

.SH REQUIREMENTS
.PP
For the current version of the package SAPHanaSR, the support is limited to the
following scenarios and parameters:
.PP
1. HANA scale-up cluster with system replication. The two HANA database
systems (primary and secondary site) are managed by one Linux cluster.
The number of nodes in that single Linux cluster is two.
Note: A three-node Linux cluster is possible, but not covered by current
best practices.
.PP
2. Technical users and groups such as sidadm are defined locally in the
Linux system.
.PP
3. Strict time synchronization between the cluster nodes, e.g. NTP.
.PP
4. For scale-up the following SAP HANA SR scenarios are supported with the
SAPHanaSR package:
.br
	4.1 performance-optimized (memory preload on secondary)
.br
	4.2 cost-optimized (e.g. with QA on secondary)
.br
	4.3 multi-tier (replication chaining, third node connected to second one)
.br
	4.4 single-tenant or multi-tenant (MDC) for all of the above
.br
	4.5 multiple independent HANA SR pairs (MCOS) in one cluster
.br
Note: For MCOS, there must be no constraints between HANA SR pairs. 
.PP
5. Only one system replication for the SAP HANA database.
.PP
6. Both SAP HANA database systems have the same SAP Identifier (SID)
and Instance Number.
.PP
7. Besides SAP HANA you need SAP hostagent to be installed and started 
on your system.
.PP
8. Automated start of SAP HANA database systems during system boot
must be switched off.
.PP
9. The RA's monitoring operations have to be active.
.PP
10. For scale-up, the current resource agent supports SAP HANA in system
replication beginning with HANA version 1.0 SPS 7 patch level 70,
recommended is SPS 11. HANA version 2.0 is supported as well.
