.SH NAME
SAPHanaFilesystem \- Monitors mounted SAP HANA filesystems.
.PP
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBSAPHanaFilesystem\fP [ start | stop | status | monitor | meta\-data | validate\-all | reload | methods | usage ]
.PP
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
SAPHanaFilesystem is a resource agent (RA) that monitors mounted SAP HANA filesystems
by checking read/write access. This RA does neither mount nor umount any filesystem.
.\" TODO stop failure conditional?
In case the filesystem monitor fails, the RA decides how to proceed based on HANA
system replication status.
The monitor and action timeouts can be significantly shorter than SAPHanaController
resource timeouts. This results in faster takeover actions.
.PP
* Behaviour on HANA primary sites
.PP
srHook=SOK: In case of monitor failure the Linux cluster tries to stop and restart
the SAPHanaFilesystem resource (not the real filesystem). If that stop fails and
the HANA system replication is in sync the node gets fenced. In consequence an
HANA sr_takeover will be triggered.
.PP
srHook=SFAIL: In case of monitor failure the Linux cluster tries to stop and restart
the SAPHanaFilesystem resource (not the real filesystem). If the HANA system
replication is not in sync this will be repeated until it gains success or
migration-threshold is reached.
.PP
* Behaviour on HANA secondary sites
.PP
In case of monitor failure the Linux cluster is not informed by SAPHanaFilesystem
resource agent.
.PP
* Background information
.PP
For HANA scale-out systems, the directory /hana/shared/$SID/ is provided as NFS
share to all nodes of a site. The directory contains binaries, tools and other
components needed for running and monitoring the HANA database. 
The NFS share for /hana/shared/$SID/ is mounted by the OS as usual.
In case of NFS failure, HANA might stop working but the Linux cluster might not
take action in reasonable time.
Due to obligatory NFS for the directory /hana/shared/$SID/, scale-out systems
are affected more often than scale-up systems.
The SAPHanaFilsystem RA can be used on local filesystems as well. This might be
useful for scale-up systems.
Even if SAPHanaFilesystem improves Linux cluster reaction on failed filesystems,
reliable filesystems are cornerstones for SAP HANA database availability.  
.PP
SAPHanaFilesystem relies on cluster attributes set by SAPHanaTopology and
susHanaSR.py, particularly hana_$SID_site_srHook_$SITE. See manual pages
ocf_suse_SAPHanaTopology(7), susHanaSR.py(7) and SAPHanaSR-showAttr(8).

* Example configuration for a SAPHanaFilesystem resource for HANA scale-out.
.PP
The HANA consists of two sites with several nodes each. An additional cluster node
is used as majority maker for split brain situations. One /hana/shared/ filesystem
is used per site. This filesystem is provided by an NFS server and shared among
all cluster nodes of that site. The NFS is not shared across sites. On each cluster
node the NFS share is mounted statically. SID is SLE, instance number is 00.

.SH REQUIREMENTS
For the current version of the SAPHanaFilesystem resource agent that comes with
the software package SAPHanaSR-angi, the support is limited
to the scenarios and parameters described in the respective manual page
SAPHanaSR-angi(7) and its references.
.PP
1. A Linux cluster STONITH method for all nodes is needed,
.br
2. on-fail=fence is set for the stop action of SAPHanaFilesystem.
.br
3. User root needs read/write access to the monitored directory. 
.br
4. SAPHanaTopology is working.
.br
5. Each site has its own filesystems. The filesystems are not shared across sites. 
.br
6. SAP HANA host auto-failover is currently not supported.
.br
7. For HANA scale-out, the SAPHanaSR-alert-fencing should be configured. See manual
page SAPHanaSR-alert-fencing(8) for details.
.\" 7. If an HANA worker node of a scale-out site got fenced but not the master
.\" nameserver, the time needed for stopping the whole site depends on HANA timeouts.
