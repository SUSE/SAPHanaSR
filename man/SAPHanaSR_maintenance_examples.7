.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
\fB*\fR Check status of Linux cluster and HANA system replication pair.

This steps should be performed before doing anything with the cluster, and
after something has been done. See also cs_show_saphanasr_status(8) and section
REQUIREMENTS below.

\fB*\fR Watch status of HANA cluster resources and system replication.

This might be conveniant when performing administrative actions or cluster tests. It does not replace the afore mentioned checks. See also cs_show_saphanasr_status(8).

.RS 4

.RE
.PP
\fB*\fR Initiate an administrative takeover of the HANA primary from one node to the other by using the Linux cluster. 

This procedure does not work for scale-out.
If the cluster should also register the former primary as secondary, AUTOMATED_REGISTER="true" is needed. Before the takeover will be initiated, the status of the Linux cluster and the HANA system replication has to be checked. The takeover should be initiated as forced migration of the multi-state SAPHana resource.
.br
Not working: Regular migration, migration of IP address, migration of primitive SAPHana resource, setting primary node standby.
.br
After takeover of the primary has been finished, the migration rule has to be deleted. If AUTOMATED_REGISTER="true" is set, finally the former primary will be registered as secondary, once the migration rule has been deleted.

Note: Former versions of the Linux cluster used "migrate" instead of "move" and "unmigrate" instead of "clear".
.PP
\fB*\fR Perform an SAP HANA takeover by using SAP tools. 

The procedures is described here for scale-out. It works for scale-up as well. 
The status of HANA databases, system replication and Linux cluster has to be
checked.
The SAP HANA resources are set into maintenance, an sr_takeover is performed,
the old primary is registered as new secondary.
Therefor the correct secondary site name has to be used, see later example.
Finally the SAP HANA resources are given back to the Linux cluster.
See also section REQUIREMENTS below and later example on determing the correct site name.

\fB*\fR Check the two site names that are known to the Linux cluster. 

This is useful in case AUTOMATED_REGISTER is not yet set. In that case a former  primary needs to be registered manually with the former site name as new secondary. The point is finding the site name that already is in use by the Linux cluster. That exact site name has to be used for registration of the new secondary. See also REQUIREMENTS of SAPHanaSR(7) and SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut(7).
.br
In this example, node is suse11 on the future secondary site to be registered. Remote HANA master nameserver is suse21 on current primary site. Lowercase-SID is ha1.

\fB*\fR Manually update global site attribute.

In rare cases the global site attribute hana_<sid>_glob_prim or
hana_<sid>_glob_sec is not updated automatically after successful takeover,
while all other attributes are updated correctly. The global site attribute
stays outdated even after the cluster has been idle for a while.
In this case, that site attribute could be updated manually.

been updated. Updating hana_<sid>_glob_sec for SID HA1 with site name VOLKACH:

\fB*\fR Upgrade scale-out srHook attribute from old-style to multi-target.

As final result of this upgrade, the RAs and hook script are upgraded from
old-style to multi-target. Further the Linux cluster's old-style global srHook
attribute hana_${sid}_glob_srHook is replaced by site-aware attributes
hana_${sid}_site_srHook_${SITE}. New auxiliary attributes are introduced.
The complete procedure and related requirements are described in detail in
manual page SAPHanaSR-manageAttr(8).
.br
The procedure at a glance:
.PP
.RS 2
a. Initially check if everything looks fine.
.br
b. Set Linux cluster resources SAPHanaController and SAPHanaTopology into maintenance.
.br
c. Install multi-target aware SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut package on all nodes.
.br
d. Adapt sudoers permission on all nodes.
.br
e. Replace HANA HADR provider configuration on both sites.
.br
f. Reload HANA HADR provider hook script on both sites.
.br
g. Check Linux cluster and HANA HADR provider for matching defined upgrade entry state.
.br
h. Migrate srHook attribute from old-style to multi-target.
.br
i. Check Linux cluster for matching defined upgrade target state.
.br
j. Set Linux cluster resources SAPHanaController and SAPHanaTopology from maintenance to managed. 
.br
k. Optionally connect third HANA site via system replication outside of the Linux cluster.

.SH REQUIREMENTS
.br
\fB*\fR For the current version of the resource agents that come with the software packages SAPHanaSR and SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut, the support is limited to the scenarios and parameters described in the respective manual pages SAPHanaSR(7) and SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut(7).
.PP
\fB*\fR Be patient. For detecting the overall HANA status, the Linux cluster
needs a certain amount of time, depending on the HANA and the configured
intervalls and timeouts.
.PP
\fB*\fR Before doing anything, always check for the Linux cluster's idle status,
left-over migration constraints, and resource failures as well as the HANA
landscape status, and the HANA SR status.
.PP
\fB*\fR Maintenance attributes for cluster, nodes and resources must not be mixed.
.PP
\fB*\fR The Linux cluster needs to be up and running to allow HA/DR provider events being written into CIB attributes. 
The current HANA SR status might differ from CIB srHook attribute after Linux cluster maintenance.
.PP
\fB*\fR Manually activating an HANA primary, like start of HANA primary or takeover outside
the cluster creates risk of a duplicate-primary situation. The user is responsible for data
integrity, particularly when activating an HANA primary.
