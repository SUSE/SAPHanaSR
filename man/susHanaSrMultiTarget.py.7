.SH NAME
susHanaSrMultiTarget.py \- Provider for multi-target aware SAP HANA srHook
method srConnectionChanged().
.PP
.\"
.\" .SH SYNOPSIS
.\" \fBSAPHanaSrMultiTarget.py\fP
.\" .PP
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
susHanaSrMultitarget.py can be used to provide a script for the SAP HANA srHook method srConnectionChanged().

The SAP HANA nameserver provides a Python-based API ("HA/DR providers"), which 
is called at important points of the host auto-failover and system replication 
takeover process. These so called hooks can be used for arbitrary operations
that need to be executed. The method srConnectionChanged() is called on the
master nameserver as soon as one of the replicating services loses or establishes the system replication connection. This method is called only once.

SAPHanaSR srHook script and resource agent need to use same cluster attributes.
Therefor beginning with package SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut version 0.180 a generation
attribute is used. 
.PP
.\"
.SH SUPPORTED PARAMETERS
\fB*\fP The "HA/DR providers" API accepts the following mandatory parameters
for the ha_dr_provider_saphanasrmultitarget section:
.TP
\fB[ha_dr_provider_sushanasrmultitarget]\fP
.TP
\fBprovider = susHanaSrMultiTarget\fP
.TP
\fBpath = /usr/share/SAPHanaSR-angi/\fP
.TP
\fBexecution_order = [ INTEGER ]\fP
.PP
Further one optional parameter can be used to control which attributes the
srHook script should access in the Linux cluster CIB. The following parameter
should be set only if requested by support engineers. The default is sufficient for normal operation.
.TP
.\" TODO check what finally is shipped
\fBcib_access = [ all-on | site-on ]\fP
.\"
.PP
The "HA/DR providers" API accepts the following optional parameter for the
system_replication section:
.TP
\fB[system_replication]\fP
.TP
\fBregister_secondaries_on_takeover = [ true | false ]\fP
.PP
The "HA/DR providers" API accepts the following mandatory parameter for the
trace section:
.TP
\fB[trace]\fP
.TP
\fBha_dr_saphanasrmultitarget = [ info | debug ]\fP
.PP
\fB*\fP The SAPHanaController RA recognizes the effecting system
replication status via attributes in the CIB properties section. The SAP System
Indentifier (sid) is given in lower case. See REQUIREMENTS section below for
supported API versions and scenarios. For SAPHanaSR-angi the
susHanaSrMultiTarget.py provides site-specific attributes among the SAPHanaSR
properties:
.TP
\fBhana_<sid>_site_srHook_<site> = [ SOK | SFAIL | SWAIT | SREG | SCOPY | PRIM ]\fP
.PP
Note: See SAPHanaSR.py(7) for old-style SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut with one global
attribute instead of site-specific attributes.
.\" TODO hana_<sid>_glob_srHook during migration process?
.PP
\fB*\fP The SAPHanaSR-manageAttr tool recognises scale-out multi-target capability via host attribute. The SAP System Indentifier (sid) is given in lower case. See REQUIREMENTS section below for supported API versions and scenarios. For new
SAPHanaSR-angi the susHanaSrMultiTarget.py reports its generation:
.TP
\fBhana_<sid>_gsh = [ \fIgeneration\fR \fB]\fP

.SH REQUIREMENTS 
1. SAP HANA starting with version 1.0 SPS11 patch level 112.02.
Older versions do not provide the srHook method srConnectionChanged().
With the mentioned HANA versions uni-directional chained system replication is
possible. With HANA 2.0 SPS04 and later multi-target system replication is
possible as well. See also SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut(7) for supported API versions and
scenarios.
.\" TODO check HANA 2.0 SPS
.PP
2. No other HADR provider hook script should be configured for the
srConnectionChanged() method. Hook scripts for other methods, provided in
SAPHanaSR-angi, can be used in parallel to susHanaSrMultiTarget.py, if
not documented contradictingly.
.PP
3. The user ${sid}adm needs execution permission as user root for the command crm_attribute.
.PP
4. The hook provider needs to be added to the HANA global configuration,
in memory and on disk (in persistence).
.PP
5. The Linux cluster needs to be up and running to allow HA/DR provider events being written into CIB attributes. The current HANA SR status might differ from CIB srHook attribute after Linux cluster maintenance.
.PP
6. The srHook script runtime almost completely depends on call-outs to OS and
Linux cluster.
.PP
7. Running srHook script and RA need to be of same or compatible generation. This is indicated by node attributes.
.PP
.\"
.SH BUGS
Old SAPHanaSR/SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut and new SAPHanaSR-angi properties for HANA SR status can not be used at same
time.
.br
In case of any problem, please use your favourite SAP support process to open
a request for the component BC-OP-LNX-SUSE.
Please report any other feedback and suggestions to feedback@suse.com.
