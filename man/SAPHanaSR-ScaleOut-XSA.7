SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut-XSA \- Automating SAP HANA system replication for stand-alone XSA setups.
.PP
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\"
This manual page provides information for setting up and managing automation of
SAP HANA system replication (SR) in scale-out setups with a stand-alone eXtended
application Services Advanced (XSA) server.
For other scale-out scenarios, please refer to SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut(7).
.PP
.\" TODO HANA XSA is
.\" .PP
The scale-out stand-alone XSA scenario consists of two nodes per site.
One node runs the HANA master namesever and an indexserver. The other node runs
an HANA nameserver slave but no indexserver. Instead of the indexserver, an
stand-alone XSA server is running.

\fB*\fP Example fss entry in /etc/fstab.
.PP
Below is an fstab example for a shared filesystem holding XSA fss TODO. 
The filesystem is statically mounted on all HANA nodes of the cluster. The
correct mount options are depending on the NFS server. However, client-side write
caching has to be disabled in any case. The path has to match fss_storage_path
in xscontroller.ini. Since the fss directory is mounted below /hana/shared, which
also comes from outside, the fss entry should follow later.
.PP
.RS 2
nfs1:/s/ha1/fss /hana/shared/HA1/xs/controller_data/ nfs4 rw,noac,sync,default 0 0

.PP
Note: The NFS share might be monitored, but not mounted/umounted by the HA cluster.

.SH REQUIREMENTS
.\"
1. The SAP HANA XSA service is installed for DNS wildcard based routing.

2. Filesystem Storage (fss) is configured identically on both sites.
.br
3. A highly available NFS service provides the shared XSA fss directory
across sites.
.br
4. Linux user <sid>adm has same UID and GIDs on all cluster nodes.
.br
5. SAP HANA host auto-failover is not supported.
.br
6. Multi-target or multi-tier system replication is not supported.
.br
7. See also REQUIREMENTS section in SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut(7).
