.SH NAME
SAPHanaSR_upgrade_to_angi \- How to upgrade from SAPHanaSR or SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut to SAPHanaSR-angi.
.PP
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fB*\fR What is the upgrade about?
.PP
SAPHanaSR-angi can be used to replace SAPHanaSR and SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut.
SAPHanaSR-angi is quite similar to SAPHanaSR and SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut, but not
fully backward compatible. Upgrading existing clusters is possible by following
a defined procedure. The upgrade should lead to the same configuration as an
installation from scratch.
.PP
The upgrade procedure depends on an initial setup as decribed in setup guides
and manual pages. See REQUIREMENTS below and in manual pages SAPHanaSR(7) or
SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut(7). The procedure does not neccesarily need downtime for
HANA, if planned and excuted carefully. Nevertheless, it should be done under
friendly conditions.
.PP
\fB*\fR What will be changed for SAP HANA scale-up scenarios?
.PP
SAPHanaSR-angi unifies HA for HANA scale-up and scale-out. Therefor it handles
scale-up as subset of scale-out, which changes the structure of attributes.
The most significant changes are listed below.
.PP
a. The SAPHana RA and its multi-state config will be replaced by the new
SAPHanaController and its clone promotable config.
.br
b. The SAPHanaSR.py HADR provider hook script will be replaced by the new
susHanaSR.py.
.br
c. Tools are placed in /usr/bin/ instead of /usr/sbin/.
.br
d. Node attributes will be removed.

\fB*\fR How does the upgrade procedure look like at a glance?
.PP
The upgrade procedure consists of four phases: preparing, removing, adding,
finalising. Linux cluster and HANA are kept running. However, resource
management is disabled and the system goes thru fragiles states during the
upgrade. 
.PP
.RS 2
1.1 Check for sane state of cluster, HANA and system replication
.br
1.2 Collect information, needed for upgrade
.br
1.3 Make backup of CIB, sudoers and global.ini
.br
2.1 Set SAPHana or SAPHanaController resource to maintenance
.br
2.2 Remove SAPHanaSR.py or SAPHanaSrMultiTarget.py from global.ini, HANA and sudoers
.br
2.3 Remove SAPHana or SAPHanaController resource config from CIB
.br
2.4 Remove SAPHanaSR property attributes from CIB
.br
2.5 Remove SAPHanaSR node attributes from CIB
.br
2.6 Remove SAPHanaSR or SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut RPM
.br
3.1 Install SAPHanaSR-angi RPM
.br
3.2 Add susHanaSR.py to sudoers, global.ini, HANA
.br
3.3 Add angi SAPHanaController resource config to CIB
.br
3.4 Refresh SAPHanaController resource and set it out of maintenance
.\" TODO set whole cluster maintenance and restart cluster, to cleanup CIB?
.br
3.5 Add SAPHanaFilesystem resource (optional)
.br
4.1 Check for sane state of cluster, HANA and system replication
.br
4.2 Test RA on secondary and trigger susHanaSR.py (optional)
.br
4.3 Remove ad-hoc backup from local directories
.RE
.PP
\fB*\fR What needs to be prepared upfront?
.PP
First make yourself familiar with concepts, components and configuration of
SAPHanaSR-angi. Refresh your knowledge of SAPHanaSR or SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut. 
.PP
Next the following information needs to be collected and documented before
upgrading a cluster:
.PP
.RS 2
1.1 Path to config backup directory at both sites
.br
1.2 Name of both cluster nodes, respectively both HANA master nameservers, see
SAPHanaSR-showAttr(8) 
.br
1.3 HANA SID and instance number, name of <sid>adm
.br
1.4 HANA virtual hostname, in case it is used
.br
1.5 Name and config of existing SAPHana, or SAPHanaController, resources and
related constraints in CIB, see ocf_suse_SAPHana(7) or
ocf_suse_SAPHanaController(7)
.br
1.6 Path to sudoers permission config file and its content, e.g. /etc/sudoers.d/SAPHanaSR
.br
1.7 Name of existing SAPHanaSR.py, or SAPHanaSrMultiTarget.py, section in
global.ini and its content, see SAPHanaSR.py(7), SAPHanaSrMultiTarget.py(7) and 
SAPHanaSR-manageProvider(8)
.br
2.1 Name and config for new SAPHanaController resources and related constraints, path to config template, see ocf_suse_SAPHanaController(7)
.br
2.2 Path to config template for new sudoers permission and its content, see
susHanaSR.py(7)
.br
2.3 Path to config template for new susHanaSR.py section, e.g. /usr/share/SAPHanaSR-angi/global.ini_susHanaSR, see susHanaSR.py(7) 
.br
2.4 Name and config for new SAPHanaFilesystem resources, path to config template
, see ocf_suse_SAPHanaFilesystem(7) (optional)
.RE
.PP
Finally prepare the config templates with correct values for the given cluster.
Ideally also the needed commands are prepared in detail.

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
\fB*\fR Example for checking sane state of cluster, HANA and system replication.
.PP
This steps should be performed before doing anything with the cluster, and after
something has been done. Usually is done per Linux cluster. See also manual
pages SAPHanaSR_maintenance_examples(7), cs_show_saphanasr_status(8) and
section REQUIREMENTS below. For scale-out, SAPHanaSR-manageAttr(8) might be
helpful as well.

.PP
\fB*\fR Example for showing SID and instance number of SAP HANA.
.PP
The installed SAP HANA instance is shown (should be only one) with its SID and
instance number. For systemd-enabled HANA the same info can be fetched from
systemd. Needs to be done at least once per Linux cluster. See also manual page
SAPHanaSR_basic_cluster(7).

.RE
.PP
\fB*\fR Example for collecting information on SAPHana resource config.
.PP
The names for SAPHana primitive and multi-state resource are determined, as
well as for related oder and (co-)location constraints. The SAPHana primitive
configuration is shown. Might be useful to see if there is anything special.
Needs to be done once per Linux cluster.
.PP

.RE
.PP
\fB*\fR Example for making a backup of CIB, sudo config and global.ini.
.PP
SID is HA1, sudo config is /etc/sudoers.d/SAPHanaSR.
.PP
.RS 2
# export BAKDIR=SAPHanaSR.$(date +%s)
.br
# mkdir ~/$BAKDIR
.br

.PP
\fB*\fR Example for removing SAPHana resource config from CIB, scale-up.
.PP
First the CIB is written to file for backup.
Next the cluster is told to not stop orphaned resources and the SAPHana
multi-state resource is set into maintenance. Next the order and colocation
constraints are removed, the SAPHana multi-state resource is removed and the
orphaned primitive is refreshed. Then the cluster is told to stop orphaned
resources. Finally the resulting cluster state is shown. 
Of course also the CIB should be checked to see if the removal was successful.
Needs to be done once per Linux cluster. SID is HA1, Instance Number is 00.
The resource names have been determined as shown in the example above.

.RE
.PP
\fB*\fR Example for removing location constraints from CIB, scale-out.
.PP
First, the same steps as for scale-up have to be done, see example above.
In addition the (anti-)location constraints for the majority maker node have to
be removed. The resource names have been determined as shown in the example above.
.PP
.RS 2

.RE
.PP
\fB*\fR Example for removing all reboot-safe node attributes from CIB.
.PP
All reboot-safe node attributes will be removed. Needed attributes are expected 
to be re-added by the RAs later.
Of course the CIB should be checked to see if the removal was successful.
Needs to be done for both nodes, or both master nameservers.
Node is node1.
See also crm_attribute(8).

\fB*\fR Example for removing non-reboot-safe node attribute from CIB, scale-up.
.PP
The attribute hana_<sid>_sync_state will be removed.
Of course the CIB should be checked to see if the removal was successful.
Needs to be done for both nodes. Scale-up only.
Node is node1, SID is HA1.
See also crm_attribute(8).

.RE
.PP
\fB*\fR Example for removing all SAPHanaSR property attributes from CIB, scale-out.
.PP
All attributes of porperty SAPHanaSR will be removed. Needed attributes are
expected to be re-added by the RAs later. The attribute for srHook will be
added by the susHanaSR.py HADR provider script and might be missing until the
HANA system replication status changes.
Of course the CIB should be checked to see if the removal was successful.
Needs to be done once per Linux cluster. Scale-out only.
See also SAPHanaSR-showAttr(8) and SAPHanaSR.py(7) or SAPHanaSrMultiTarget.py(7)
respectively.

.RE
.PP
\fB*\fR Example for removing the SAPHanaSR.py hook script from global.ini and HANA.
.PP
The global.ini is copied for backup. Next the exact name (upper/lower case) of
the section is determined from global.ini. Then the currenct HADR provider
section is shown. If the section is identical with the shipped template, it can
be removed easily from the configuration. Finally the HADR provider hook script 
is removed from running HANA. Needs to be done for each HANA site.
SID is HA1, case sensitive HADR provider name is SAPHanaSR. The example is given
for scale-up SAPHanaSR.py, for scale-out SAPHanaSrMultiTarget.py might be
removed instead. The path /usr/sbin/ is used, because this step is done while
the old RPM is still installed. See manual page SAPHanaSR.py(7) or
SAPHanaSrMultiTarget.py(7) for details on checking the hook script integration.

.PP
First the SAPHanaController multi-state resource is refreshed, then it is set
out of maintenance. Name of the resource is mst_SAPHanaController_HA1_HDB00.
Of course status of cluster, HANA and system replication needs to be checked
before and after this action, see example above. Needs to be done once per
Linux cluster. See also manual page SAPHanaSR_maintenance_examples(7).
.br
Note: The srHook status for HANA secondary site migh be empty.

\fB*\fR Example for testing RA on secondary site and trigger susHanaSR.py.
.PP
This step is optional.
The secondary node is determined from SAPHanaSR-showAttr. On that node, the
hdbnameserver is killed. The cluster will recover the secondary HANA and set
the CIB attribute srHook.
Of course status of cluster, HANA and system replication needs to be checked.

SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut respectively, and SAPHanaSR-angi.
.br
* The resource configuration matches a documented setup. Even if the general
upgrade procedure is expected to work for customised configuration, details
might need special treatment.
.br
* The whole upgrade procedure is tested carefully and documented in detail
before being applied on production.
.br
* Linux cluster, HANA and system replication are in sane state before the
upgrade. All cluster nodes are online.
.br
* The HANA database is idle during the upgrade. No other changes on OS, cluster,
database or infrastructure are done in parallel to the upgrade.
.br
* Linux cluster, HANA and system replication are checked and in sane state
before set back into production.
