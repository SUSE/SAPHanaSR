.SH NAME
SAPHanaSR.py \- Provider for SAP HANA srHook method srConnectionChanged().
.PP
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
SAPHanaSR.py can be used to provide a script for the SAP HANA srHook method
srConnectionChanged().

The SAP HANA nameserver provides a Python-based API ("HA/DR providers"), which
is called at important points of the host auto-failover and system replication
takeover process. These so called hooks can be used for arbitrary operations that
need to be executed. The method srConnectionChanged() is called on the master
nameserver as soon as one of the replicating services loses or establishes
the system replication connection. This method is called only once.

SAPHanaSR.py updates the cluster attribute srHook at changes of the HANA system
replication status. Thus this attribute is more reliable than the attribute
sync_state which is polled by RA monitors.

This hook script needs to be configured and activated on all HANA nodes.

.SH SUPPORTED PARAMETERS
* The "HA/DR providers" API accepts the following parameters for the
ha_dr_provider_SAPHanaSR section:
.TP
\fB[ha_dr_provider_saphanasr]\fP
.TP
\fBprovider = SAPHanaSR\fP
Mandatory. Must not be changed.
.TP
\fBpath = /usr/share/SAPHanaSR\fP
Mandatory. Please change only if requested.
.TP
\fBexecution_order = [ INTEGER ]\fP
Mandatory. Order might depend on other hook scripts.
.PP
* The "HA/DR providers" API accepts the following parameter for the trace section:
.TP
\fB[trace]\fP
.TP
\fBha_dr_saphanasr = [ info | debug ]\fP
Optional. Will be added automatically if not set.
.PP
* The he SAPHanaController and SAPHana RA recognize the effecting system
replication status via attributes in the CIBÂ´s SAPHanaSR properties section.
The SAP System Indentifier (sid) is given in lower case:
.TP
\fBhana_${sid}_site_srHook_${site} = [ SOK | SFAIL | SWAIT ]\fP
.TP
Note: SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut comes with a differnt SAPHanaSR.py that provides global attributes.

* Example for entry in SAP HANA 2.0 global configuration
/hana/shared/$SID/global/hdb/custom/config/global.ini to enable multi-target aware third site.
.br
This entry is needed to allow ocf_suse_SAPHana(7) parameter AUTOMATED_REGISTER=true in multi-target environments.
The HANA has to be stopped before the files can be edited.
Do not copy the file between nodes. Please check SAP HANA documentation for details.

.PP
* Potentially dangerous example for manually changing Linux cluster srHook
attribute according to current HANA SR state. This might be desired if the
HANA SR state has changed while the Linux cluster was completely down.
SID is ICE, site is BERG, current HANA SR state is SFAIL.

.PP
\fB*\fR Example for removing orphaned global srHook attribute.
This might be done after upgrading from old-style srHook, to avoid confusion
caused by different HANA HADR provider API versions.
See also SAPHanaSR.py(7) and SAPHanaSR-manageAttr(8) from SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut.
SID is HA1.

.SH REQUIREMENTS
1. SAP HANA 2.0 SPS04 or later provides the HA/DR provider hook method
srConnectionChanged() with multi-target aware parameters.
SAP HANA 1.0 does not provide them.
The multi-target aware parameters are needed for the SAPHanaSR scale-up
package.
.PP
2. No other HADR provider hook script should be configured for the
srConnectionChanged() method. Hook scripts for other methods, provided in
SAPHanaSR, can be used in parallel to SAPHanaSR.py, if not documented
contradictingly.
.PP
3. The user ${sid}adm needs execution permission as user root for the command
crm_attribute.
.PP
4. The hook provider needs to be added to the HANA global configuration,
in memory and on disk (in persistence).
.PP
5. If the hook provider should be pre-compiled, the particular Python version
that comes with SAP HANA has to be used.
