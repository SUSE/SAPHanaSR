SAPHanaSR_basic_cluster \- SAP HANA System Replication scale-up basic cluster configuration.
.PP
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The SAP HANA System Replication scale-up scenario needs a certain basic
cluster configuration. Besides this necessary settings, some additional
configurations might match specific needs. Adapting a few SAP HANA settings
might be beneficial as well.
.\"

.PP
\fB* CRM Basics\fR
.PP
\fBdefault-resource-stickiness = 1000\fR
.PP
The crm basic parameter default-resource-stickiness defines the 'stickiness'
score a resource gets on the node where it is currently running. This prevents
the cluster from moving resources around without an urgent need during a
cluster transition. The correct value depends on number of resources, colocation
rules and resource groups. Particularly additional groups colocated to the
HANA primary master resource can affect cluster decisions. 
Too high value might prevent not only unwanted but also useful actions.
This is because SAPHanaSR uses an internal scoring table for placing the HANA
roles on the right nodes.
.br
Mandatory, default 1.
.PP
\fBfailure-timeout = 86400\fR
.PP
The crm basic parameter failure-timeout defines how long failed actions will
be kept in the CIB. After that time the failure record will be deleted. The
time is measured in seconds. See also migration-threshold below.
.br
Optional, no default.
.PP
\fBmigration-threshold = 5000\fR
.PP
The crm basic parameter migration-threshold defines how many errors on a
resource can be detected before this resource will be migrated to another node.
See also \fBfailure-timeout\fR.
.br
Mandatory, default 3.
.PP
\fBrecord-pending = true\fR
.PP
The op_default record-pending defines, whether the intention of an action
upon the resource is recorded in the Cluster Information Base (CIB).
Setting this parameter to 'true' allows the user to see pending actions like
 'starting' and 'stopping' in \fBcrm_mon\fR and \fBHawk\fR.
.br
Optional, default false.
.PP
\fBpcmk_delay_max = 30\fR
.PP
The sbd stonith parameter pcmk_delay_max defines an upper limit for waiting
before a fencing/stonith request will be triggerd.
This parameter should prevent the cluster from unwanted double fencing in case
of spilt-brain. A value around 30 seconds is required in two-node clusters,
except priority fencing is used.
.br
Mandatory, default 5.
.PP
\fBpriority-fencing-delay = 30\fR
.PP
The optional crm property priority-fencing-delay specified delay for the
fencings that are targeting the lost nodes with the highest total resource
priority in case we do not have the majority of the nodes in our cluster
partition, so that the more significant nodes potentially win any fencing
match, which is especially meaningful under split-brain of 2-node cluster.
A promoted resource instance takes the base priority + 1 on calculation if
the base priority is not 0. Any delay that are introduced by pcmk_delay_max
configured for the corresponding fencing resources will be added to this
delay. A meta attribute priority=100 or alike for the SAPHanaController
primitive resource is needed to make this work. See ocf_suse_SAPHanaController(7).
The delay should be significantly greater than, or safely twice,
pcmk_delay_max.
.br
Optional, no default.
.PP
\fB* systemd Basics\fR
.PP
\fBsaphostagent.service enabled\fR
.br
\fBSAP${SID}_${INO}.service enabled\fR
.PP
In case systemd-style init is used for the HANA database, the services
saphostagent and SAP${SID}_${INO} need to be enabled and running inside the SAP
slice. The instance profile Autostart feature needs to be off.
The service saptune is highly recommended, see manual page saptune(8).
.PP
\fB* pacemaker service dependency to SAP instance service\fR
.PP
\fB[Unit]\fR
.br
\fBWants=SAP${SID}_${INO}.service\fR
.br
\fBAfter=SAP${SID}_${INO}.service\fR
.PP
In case systemd-style init is used for the HANA database, it might be desired
to have the SAP instance service stopping after pacemaker at system shutdown.
Therefor a drop-in file for the pacemaker service might help. See examples below.
.PP
\fB* pacemaker service basics\fR
.PP
\fBPCMK_fail_fast = yes\fR
.PP
The parameter PCMK_fail_fast in /etc/sysconfig/pacemaker specifies how pacemaker
reacts on failures of its subdaemons. Default "no" means to restart failed
subdaemons, while "yes" means fencing the node. Setting "yes" might help to avoid
undefined situations.
.br
Optional, default no

.br
\fBfinal_memory_release_shutdown = [ auto | on | off ]\fR
.br
\fBfinal_memory_release_crash = [ auto | on | off ]\fR
.PP
Starting with SAP HANA 2.0 SPS06, the database shutdown can be accelerated by
optimizing memory de-allocation. Please refer to SAP documentation before setting
this parameters.

\fB[daemon]\fR
.br
\fBterminationtimeout = [ \fImillisec\fB ]\fR
.br
\fBforcedterminationtimeout = [ \fImillisec\fB ]\fR
.PP
The first parameter defines the timeout from sending SIGTERM to finally terminating
child processes when HANA is shutting down by the STOP event. Used also as maximal
delay in system restart if 'restartterminationtimeout' parameter is not set.
The second defines the timeout from sending the SIGTERM to finally terminating
child processes when HANA is shutting down by the QUIT event.
Please refer to SAP documentation before setting this parameters.

\fB* crm simple SBD stonith configuration\fR

To complete the SBD setup, it is necessary to activate SBD as STONITH/fencing
mechanism in the CIB. The SBD is normally used for SAPHanaSR scale-up
instead of any other fencing/stonith mechanism. Example for a basic disk-based
SBD resource:

\fB* crm grouped IP address resource configuration\fR
.PP
Let the Linux cluster manage one IP address and move that address along
with the HANA primary master nameserver. An auxiliary resource is needed
for specific public cloud purpose.
.PP
You should not bind resource to the HANA master role. This would change the
effective resource scoring and might prevent the cluster from taking expected
actions. If, for any reason, you need to bind additional resource to the
HANA resource, you need to reduce that additional resourceÂ´s stickiness to 1.

.PP
\fB* crm MailTo resource configuration\fR
.PP
The HANA landscape status is stored inside CIB as attribute hana_<sid>_roles.
A healthy HANA master looks like "4:P:master1:master:worker:master".
First field is the HANA landscape status. If that status goes to 3 or 2,
something has happened to HANA, but the cluster will not perform a takeover.
Status 1 will trigger a takeover, status 0 indicates an undefined fatal failure.
See manual pages ocf_suse_SAPHanaController(7) and ocf_heartbeat_MailTo(7). 
.PP
You could define a MailTo resource that informs you as soon as attribute
hana_<sid>_roles deviates from above ideal:
.PP
.RS 2
primitive rsc_mailto_HA1_HDB10 MailTo \\
.br
 params email="root@localhost" subject="hana_ha1_roles changed" \\
.br
 op monitor timeout=10 interval=30 depth=0 \\

.br
 rule hana_ha1_roles eq 4:P:master1:master:worker:master
.RE
.PP
\fB* check how resource stickiness affects promotion scoring\fR
.PP
SAPHanaSR uses an internal scoring table. The promotion scores for HANA
primary and secondary master are in a certain range. The scores used by the
Linux cluster should be in the same range.
.PP
.RS 2
.br
# SAPHanaSR-showAttr | grep master.:master

In rare cases the SBD stonith resource fails writing to the block device.
After the root cause has been found and fixed, the failure message can be
cleaned.
