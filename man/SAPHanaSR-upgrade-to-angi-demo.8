.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
SAPHanaSR-upgrade-to-angi-demo demonstrates how to upgrade from SAPHanaSR to
SAPHanaSR-angi. The script collects information from an Linux HA cluster with
SAPHanaSR. Based on that data it suggests step by step the commands to upgrade the cluster. The running configuration is not changed. See also manual page
SAPHanaSR_upgrade_to_angi(7).
.PP
.B SAPHanaSR-upgrade-to-angi-demo is shipped as technology preview.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 4
\fB --help\fP
show help.
.TP 4
\fB --version\fP
show version.
.TP 4
\fB --check\fP
do some basic checks on configuration and status of Linux cluster.
.TP 4
\fB --list\fP
list SAPHanaSR-upgrade-to-angi-demo functions.
.TP 4
\fB --run \fP \fIFUNCTION\fP [ \fIFUNCTION\fP [ ... ]]
run given function(s). Not all functions will work, once CIB attributes have been deleted. 
.TP 4
\fB --upgrade\fP
show demo for upgrade from SAPHanaSR to SAPHanaSR-angi.

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
\fB*\fP Example for copying the script to outside the package.
.PP
The script needs to be still available on both cluster nodes after the SAPHanaSR
RPM has been removed. Needs to be done on all cluster nodes.

.PP
\fB*\fP Example for checking sane state of cluster.
.PP
This steps should be performed before doing anything with the cluster, and after
something has been done.

.PP
\fB*\fP Example for checking pre-requisites for the upgrade.
.PP
Should be done on all Linux cluster nodes before the upgrade. Any error
message should be investigated. The check covers several requirements for the
upgrade, but not all. On the other hand, some of the pre-requisites are caused
by limitations of the script SAPHanaSR-upgrade-to-angi-demo itself. Those might
not be needed for doing the real upgrade manually.

.PP
\fB*\fP Example for demonstrating an upgrade.
.PP
HANA´s SID and instance number will be detected, as well as the names of both
cluster nodes. The names of cluster resources and constraints will be derived
from the CIB. Based on that information, command sequences will be proposed for
performing an upgrade: 
.br
- Backing up old CIB, sudoers file and global.ini.
.br
- Setting HANA resource into maintenance mode.
.br
- Removing old rules from sudoers file on both nodes.
.br
- Removing old hook scripts from global.ini on both nodes.
.br
- Removing old SAPHanaSR package.
.br
- Adding new SAPHanaSR-angi package.
.br
- Adding new rules to sudoers file on both nodes.
.br
- Adding new hook scripts to global.ini on both nodes.
.br
- Removing old cluster resources and constraints removed from CIB.
.br
- Removing old node attributes and SAPhanaSR properties from CIB.
.br
- Adding new cluster resources and constraints to CIB.
.br
- Setting HANA resource back to managed.
.PP
Before doing this, you should check and prepare pre-requisites, see example
above.
The script should be used on the HANA primary node.
See also SAPHanaSR_upgrade_to_angi(7).

.PP
\fB*\fP Example for drafting a runbook for the manual upgrade.
.PP
The runbook draft is stored as file "SAPHanaSR-upgrade-draft.txt". This draft
can be used for preparing details for the upgrade procedure. 
The script should be used on the HANA primary node.
See also SAPHanaSR_upgrade_to_angi(7).

.SH REQUIREMENTS
.PP
* The initial configuration matches SUSE´s documented setup of the SAPHanaSR
scale-up performance-optimised scenario.
.br
* Linux cluster, HANA and system replication are in sane state before the
upgrade. All cluster nodes are online.
.br
* Package libxml2-tools is installed on both cluster nodes.
.br
* SAPHanaSR-upgrade-to-angi-demo is copied into /root/bin/ and made executable
on both cluster nodes.
.br
* SAPHanaSR-upgrade-to-angi-demo is executed on the HANA primary node.
.br
* SAPHanaSR-upgrade-to-angi-demo could be run on test systems. It must not be
run on production systems.
.br
* For further requirements see manual page SAPHanaSR_upgrade_to_angi(7).
