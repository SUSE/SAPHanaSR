angi-ScaleOut+XSA means a Scale-Out SAP HANA with one (or more??) additional XSA "Standalone" node.
In HANA Topology this is a scale-out, but the additional XSA nodes second node are neither a index-worker nor a standby node.
The XSA standalones should have a slave nameserver-role and NO indexserver role.
